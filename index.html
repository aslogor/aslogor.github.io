<p>I am a mathematical physicist and differential geometer, currently holding a predoctoral researcher position at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences (<a href="https://www.icmat.es/" target="_blank">ICMAT</a>) in Madrid, Spain. I have written my PhD dissertation, titled <em>The geometry of dissipation</em>, under the supervision of Prof. Manuel de León. Following the defense of my thesis, scheduled for September 18, 2024, I will be joining the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (<a href="https://www.impan.pl/en" target="_blank">IM PAN</a>) in Warsaw, Poland, as an assistant professor, under the mentorship of Prof. <a href="https://www.impan.pl/~jagrab/" target="_blank">Janusz Grabowski</a>.

<!-- 
<p>I'm a mathematical physicist and differential geometer. I'm doing a PhD at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences (<a href="https://www.icmat.es/" target="_blank">ICMAT</a>) in Madrid (Spain), under the supervision of Prof. Manuel de León. My area of research is geometric mechanics. More specifically, my PhD thesis is about the geometrical aspects of dynamical systems with dissipation. I currently hold a predoctoral researcher position (PRE2020-093814) from the Spanish Research Council (<a href="https://www.csic.es/en" target="_blank">CSIC</a>). Once I defend my thesis, I will join to the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (<a href="https://www.impan.pl/en" target="_blank">IM PAN</a>) in Warsaw (Poland) as an assistant professor, under the mentorship of Prof. <a href="https://www.impan.pl/~jagrab/" target="_blank">Janusz Grabowski</a>.

<!-- 
<p>I'm a PhD student in Mathematics at the Autonomous University of Madrid. I previously obtained a BSc in Physics at the Complutense University of Madrid and a MSc in Theoretical Physics at the Autonomous University of Madrid. Even though I studied physics, I've always liked pure mathematics as well, so I decided to become a mathematical physicist. I'm specially interested in the mathematical foundations of the physical theories and, conversely, the physical motivation for developments in mathematics.</p> -->
